== ktlint convention plugin

IMPORTANT: The plugin requires a Gradle version of 6.0 or higher.

The plugin applies the link:https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle[ktlint-gradle] plugin and configures it with a custom link:https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint[ktlint] rule set with rules extracted from the development of the link:https://github.com/gradle/kotlin-dsl[gradle/kotlin-dsl].

The rule set is the standard `ktlint` ruleset with a few rules on top.
See the link:src/test/kotlin/org/gradle/kotlin/dsl/experiments/plugins/GradleKotlinDslKtlintConventionPluginTest.kt[integration tests] for more information.

=== Usage

Request the plugin using the following:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("org.gradle.kotlin-dsl.ktlint-convention") version "0.6.0"
}
```

Then run `ktlint` checks:

```
gradle ktlintCheck
```
